# TASKMASTER
Since there is a clear need to avoid procrastination , our team decided to create a program to help students overcome it by creating 4 components . It consists of an alarm clock , website blocker , pomodoro timer and a to do list . This is my first project i have created on python.

The whole code is written in python , there is no front end to the code.


First you need to install 2 modules using COMMAND PROMPT:
1)pip install datetime

Now since both of our modules are installed the python code is enough to work .

You can run the python code and easily access the program.
